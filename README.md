# Rain-Fall-prediction
This classification project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict whether it would rain in Sydney tomorrow. The dataset contained various weather-related features, including the date, minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall amount, humidity, air pressure, cloud cover, temperature at different times of the day, and indicators for rain today and tomorrow. The data preprocessing phase began with checking for duplicates, which were carefully handled to maintain data integrity. Missing values were filled using appropriate imputation techniques. The rainfall amount feature was transformed using MinMaxScaler followed by a logarithmic transformation to normalize its distribution and improve the model's handling of this feature. Outliers were identified and addressed to enhance data quality and reliability.
A correlation matrix was utilized to analyze relationships between features and select the most significant independent variables for the prediction task. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio to evaluate model performance effectively. Various classification algorithms were employed, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. These models were trained and fine-tuned to maximize their predictive capabilities.
To assess the performance of each model, confusion matrices and accuracy scores were used, allowing a detailed comparison to identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting rainfall. This project showcased a systematic approach to solving a weather prediction problem, leveraging advanced data preprocessing techniques and a diverse range of classification methods. The outcomes provided meaningful insights into the factors influencing rainfall and contributed to enhancing decision-making in weather forecasting for Sydney.
